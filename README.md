### Udacity Projects

I worked on three projects while taking the Udacity Nanodegree program, these projects helped me up my python skills and improved my analytical thinking. You can find them linked below:

- [Investigating A Dataset 🏥](https://github.com/funwarej/noshow_appointments)
  
  This project investigates hospital data to determine why patients miss their hospital appointments.
  
- [Wrangle And Analyze](https://github.com/funwarej/data_wrangling)
  
  In this project, data was gathered from @weratedogs twitter page via the twitter API and their twitter archive. The tweets were analysed and insights were gotten from the analysis.
  
- [Communicate Findings](https://github.com/funwarej/bikeshare_exploration)
  
  This project focused on the visualization 🌈 libraries of python 🐍 (matplotlib and seaborn) to create exploratory and explanatory visuals to convey findings from the analysis of a bikeshare service data.
